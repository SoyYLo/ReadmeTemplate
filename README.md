# Readme-Template

## User Story
As a developer 
I want to create a README Generator 
So that other developers and I can have a template to quickly create a README file for a new project.

## Description 
When I open the command line and run the index file using node, I am given a set of questions to answer.
I am able to input my name, title of my project, my User Story, and decription about my project. 
This README generator will also ask me for my email, Github name, and a link to my Github as options to contact me.
Then I am able to input more information and resources used for me to complete my project.
This information includes the license, language usage, installation process, and any contributors associated with my project.
Once I am finished answering the set of questions, then I am provided with a README file written in a specified folder.
I will see all my information I provided is properly and accurately listed in each corresponding section of the README file.
I am able to click on links in the Table of Contents section and I will automatically be brought to that section of the README.
